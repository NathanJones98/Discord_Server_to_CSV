# Pulling Discord Data Instrcutions

Prepared in conjunction with LabDAO <> TalentDAO on their collaborative effort on server health and community interaction. 
This bot saves server communications in a format suitable to perform natural language inference and organizational psychometrics.

This bot is still in active development to add more fields and to integrate with cloud databasing solutions for continuous updating of server data.

## Summary

### Discord Server
If you encounter any issues with the installation of the bot, have a feature request, or want to contribute feel free to join the discord [server](https://discord.gg/QATr8ugAmw).

---

### Dependencies
This execution of a server exporting bot is done using Python on top of the disnake pythonic discord API and outputs a server cache to a location of your choice on your local machine. 

Package Requirements:

    - Python 3.8+
    - Disnake==2.5.1
    - Pandas, current distribution
    - aiohttp
    
This implementation also requires you to have a bot token created through the discord developer portal, found [here](https://discord.com/login?redirect_to=%2Fdevelopers%2Fapplications). That is added to the target server. It is required that the bot has 'read_channel_history' permissions turned on. 
A discord update now locks some of this functionality behind "privledged intents", so make sure the slider to enable these and the discord dev portal is turned on.

## Included Commands

1. CSV Channel
    - Run with !!CSVChannel
    - Makes a cache of the channel in which the command message is sent and saves to a CSV. 
2. CSVServer
    - Run with !!CSVServer
    - Makes a individual CSV for every channel in the server with each CSV titled the same as the channel.
3. SingleCSV
    - Run with !!SingleCSV 
    - Makes one CSV with every message sent in the server, with a column identifying which channel each message was sent in.

Output Fields:

    - Discord Usernames 
    - Discord Discriminator 
    - Message Content
    - Users Mentioned in the Message
    - Time Stamp 
    - If using 'SingleCSV' channel name is included.

If needed, an output that includes attachments, replies and other media can be developed in the future. Saving channel threads and links to message attachments will go into development in the near future.

## Bot Installation and Setup 

The method requires three total files:

    - bot_main.py 
    - config.py 
    - cache_channel.py

As I am not familiar with the details of your machine, I will leave the installation of python and the relevant packages to you. 
All that is needed is a Python environment with Pandas and the disnake package installed. 
For a quick tutorial about making a bot and getting a token, see this [tutorial](https://www.howtogeek.com/364225/how-to-make-your-own-discord-bot/).

1. Editing the Config File:
    - After making a bot on the discord developer portal,copy the token into the 'token section' of the file. 
    - The command prefix is the text string that triggers the bot, it can be changed based on user preference.
    - Do not change the "permissions" field.
    - The bot defaults to saving the output in the same folder as the code. If you would like to change this, put the file path in the form of a string in this field.

2. Add the bot to your discord server.
    - How to do this is covered in the tutorial linked above. 
    - The bot will automatically generate itself a role, make sure it has read channel history permissions. 

3. From your terminal, run bot_main.py.
    - You should see the bot appear online in discord and see a message printed on you terminal confirming your are logged in. 

4. In the discord type the name of a command with the command prefix set in the config file without spaces.
    - Example !!CSVServer
    - User sending the message must have administrator permission within the server.

5. Command completion.
    - After step 4, a CSV with '~' as its deliminator should appear in the desired location. and a Command complete message will appear in the terminal. 
    - For debugging, contact me **kellyd73#0168** on discord or join the CSV_Bot [server](https://discord.gg/QATr8ugAmw) to ask questions.


## Full End to End Using Conda
    
Install the lastest conda distribution from [their website](https://www.anaconda.com/) for your website. 
In terminal, run the following commands sequentially, assuming your 'base' conda environment is active:

Create and activate conda env:
    
    conda create --name {your_env_name}
    conda activate {your_env_name}
    
Create a target directory where you want the bot to be stored:

    mkdir path/to/desired/location
    cd path/to/desired/location
    
Clone the git repository to the desired location:

    git clone https://github.com/kjwallace/Discord_Server_to_CSV
    cd Discord_Server_to_CSV
    
Install the relevant packages from requirements:

    conda install pip 
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    
    
Use vi or a code editor of your choice to insert your bot token into the config.py file and change the output path as desired.
Run the bot by moving into the Cache_Bot directory:

    cd Cache_Bot
    python bot_main.py
    
After you run bot_main.py, your bot should appear online in your server and respond to the included commands.
